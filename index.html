                <p>My name is Alayu Estifanos, and I’m a professional web developer and graphical designer. 
                    I’ve just joined the software department in addis ababa University as a student.
                    I’ll be getting a good knowledge with some, informational and technological issues, 
                    If you see a new face around, well, that’s me:) I am currently in my second year of my Early 
                    Childhood Study’s Degree. I am 20 years old and live in large family of 5 siblings.
  
                  I have previously studied java and python and html my A-levels and throughout my years of learning.
                  I can honestly put forward that knowledge can always be captured no matter what the profession, 
                  there is no such thing as too much knowledge. In addition, I am extremely grateful to have gained 
                  all my experiences and skills and will always keep an eye out for new opportunities.In the beginning
                   of my academic year I witnessed a major difference between the learning environment, this is mainly because 
                   I transitioned through differnert programming languages where the environment was more controlled and students 
                   were less independent.
                  
                  University to me in comparison to our preparatory school, felt more independent and relaxed, however although in
                   the beginning I was quite frightened by the change of environment and people, with the help of the staff I managed
                    to make new friends from all age groups. This enabled me to share my experience as well as gain an insight into other 
                    individuals experiences.

                  I believ in the principle of Knowledge is the essence of smart thinking. No matter how much raw intelligence I have, I am not going to succeed at solving complex problems without knowing a lot.
                  
                  That's why I spend the first 20 years of my lives in school. It is also important to study over a period of days rather waiting until the last minute …show more content…So, self-testing needs to involve deeper questions than the ones that are usually written on flash cards.From my universty most of universty students tend to focus their study on upcoming assignments. That is no surprise, because college is a busy time.The most successful students, though, also schedule time to study for classes even before the exam is coming up. The students who make a schedule and stick with it tend to get better grades than those who just work on whatever is coming up. Finally,the time of day that students study also matters. College students are notorious night owls. Indeed, few students reported studying in the morning, or even in the afternoon. Most students study in the evening and late at night.
                  One of the interesting results of this research, though, is that the students who study late at night tend to get worse grades than those who study in the evening. It is always nice when studies of real-world behavior mesh with recommendations from basic research. In the case of studying, though, it seems particularly important to ensure that basic research influences behavior. People invest several years and thousands of dollars in a college education. That education has an enormous effect on their future productivity. Cognitive science can ensure that students maximize the value of that experience.

        <h1 class="text-center">My Study Strategy</h1>
        <p class="text-center">Every day, I studies some books that is neccessary to become a professional website developer. some of my studying strategy and some of my adives are as follows</p>

            <p>First Revision timetable
    
              A great place to start your study strategy is to devise a routine. Research suggests that short study blocks with frequent breaks are most effective. Combine this with mixing the subject areas throughout the day to give yourself more variety. Also, set yourself clear daily, weekly and monthly targets – this makes it easier to track your progress in relation to the exam date.
              
              Second Learning maps
              Map out what you need to learn. Get colourful and creative, use mind maps, Venn diagrams and topic trees to clearly layout what you need to study. This will help you visualise the topics and find synergies between them.
              
              Third Spaces and places
              Find a place that suits how you study. For most it’s somewhere quiet with little distraction, like a library or a small café. Everyone’s different, so as long as it works for you - stick with it.
              
              Finaly you ,must select When and how caan you read more
              If you’re a full time student then you can devote all day to studying, though as mentioned above, you still need to plan a strategy – having so much time on your hands can be overwhelming and doing nothing but studying can actually be a frustration. Alternatively, for those working and/or with families, you need to study as and when you can, so the temptation will be to study intensively, but you should follow some structure to your sessions and factor in breaks and time to reflect.</p>

              I want to prove to my family that someday I will walk on stage with my Bachelor’s degree and thank them for all the hardships they went through for me for me to have a better life and a proper education.With my dreams set high, I have my own career and life goals in order for me to graduate with a BSc in Software Engineering to someday work in the IT field.
              
              I’m a firm believer of the importance of writing down your goals. I manage to write down every single one of my goals down on post-it paper and put them on my wall. My goals are very important to me because it’s something that I want to accomplish in my life. These goals will help me become successful in life.someday become successful Software Engineer, and work as a computer science professions.In order to achieve these goals and to get some extra money I sould be work hard now.
