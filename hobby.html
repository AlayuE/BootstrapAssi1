            <p class="text-center">Listening to Music	Reading Books
                Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music can be 
                traced back to when I was a child. There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever 
                music was played. I would run to the stereo, turn on the music to full volume and start running around dancing. 
                Anyone who dared touch the sound system would face my wrath. Music was the only thing that could calm me down whenever I cried. 
                I always have this weird feeling that my destiny is somehow intertwined with music. In my early teenage years, my girlfriends and
                 I would sneak into the garage, where my brother and his band mates kept their musical equipment. Music gives me the needed 
                 refuge whenever I feel like my head is spinning and I just want to shut out everything around me. The good thing about 
                 music is that there is music for every occasion and feeling. Whenever I feel depressed, I listen to sad songs. 
                 They guide me and keep me company during those trying moments. Whenever I’m happy, I have a collection of party songs that
                  I dance to for hours to amplify the good feeling. The beauty of music is that it can be incorporated with other hobbies. 
                  For instance, I love reading a good book, as nice orchestra music is playing in the background.</p>

              <h1 class="text-center">Reading Books</h1>
              <p class="text-center">
                I’m passionate about reading. Although I have several hobbies, such as watching movies and hiking, 
                reading books is what resonates well with me. There are many reasons why I love reading. The first reason 
                is it gives me a level of fulfillment. That is, books rejuvenate me. After reading a book, I feel like a whole 
                new being and my outlook in life changes. The second reason is books make my mind sharp. It is a known fact that 
                books improve our brain muscles. They make us think better and improve our decision making abilities. 
                I find it funny that whenever I utter a clever quote from a book, everyone around me would be dumbfounded.

            <h1 class="text-center">Travelling</h1>
          <p class="text-center">Travelling is one of those few activities that has a kind of reset button in our lives. You go away for a few days 
              or weeks and come back fresh and ready to take on challenges of life head on. Travelling to many people is a matter 
              of convenience, rather than a recreation activity. They only travel when they have an issue to attend to. Travelling is
               also not for escapists, as many people tend to believe. I used the word ‘escapists’ not in the literary sense of the word, 
               but rather to mean people who run away from their problems. Travelling is a hobby like any other.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center">Playing</h1>
            <p class="text-center">
                Life is not always easy; it is usually hectic. During the daily routine life, we do our tasks and enjoy our spare time with 
                some activity. This activity is our hobby. My hobby is playing football. football is my favorite sport. When I get some 
                free time after my studies,I go outside to the ground with my friends and play football. Football is the game which requires
                 physical fitness and tacktics. The running between persons and trying to score the gools, fielding within the ground and stress 
                 bearing during batting and fielding make my body fit and mind fresh. So, after playing cricket when I study, I can better grab 
                 the concepts. I also become delighted by playing football because I don’t waste my mind chewing chat or playing video games.
                  Instead, I do some healthy activity. Although I love my hobby, it is no more than my study. I do my study first and then and 
                  I enjoy myself with a Hobby. Hence I maintain a balance.

            <h1 class="text-center">Dancing</h1>
          <p class="text-center">
            Dance – the only art form in which we ourselves are a tool. Ever since childhood, I have been an active and lively child, I liked the music and I’m hearing a couple of rhythmic sounds, selflessly start to dance. And that’s where I grew up a little bit and I was 15 Years old, my mother invited me to go to my neighboor marriage ceremony.At first, I was afraid and capricious, but he found himself in a spacious and cozy at the same time dance hall, I felt not a little worse than feeling at home, dancing in front of mass of peoples.
